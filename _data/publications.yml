  title: "ReFlex: Text-Guided Editing of Real Images in Rectified Flow via Mid-Step Feature Extraction and Attention Adaptation"
  venue: ICCV, 2025 Highlight
  description: 
    - We developed a new real-image editing approach for FLUX, leveraging analysis of intermediate representations.
    - ReFlex achieved text alignment improvements of 1.69-7.11% on PIE-Bench and 3.21-16.46% on Wild-TI2I-Real.

  title: "Harmonizing Visual and Textual Embeddings for Zero-Shot Text-to-Image Customization"
  venue: AAAI, 2025
  description: 
    - We discovered a conflict among contextual embeddings in zero-shot T2I customization. 
    - By resolving the conflict, we improved text alignment by 3.82-5.26% and image alignment by 2.11-12.2%.
